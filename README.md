# GoFresco App

This is a Next.js e-commerce application for a grocery store, built with modern web technologies.

## What's next? How do I make an app with this?

This project uses a simplified architecture with JSON data files instead of a database, making it easy to get started and deploy.

## Data Structure

The application uses JSON files in the `/data` directory to store product information:
- `alimentari.json` - Grocery products
- `casa.json` - Household products  
- `frutta.json` - Fruits
- `verdura.json` - Vegetables

## How do I deploy this?

Since this app doesn't require a database, you can easily deploy it to Vercel, Netlify, or any static hosting provider.
